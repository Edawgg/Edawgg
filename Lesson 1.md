       <p>I am Ethan as you can see in my header. I am the son of a fellow web developer.
        That is truly the main reason and motivation behind attending this specific bootcamp.
        I have many skill sets in the manual labor/trade industry. I just have gotten to a 
        point in my life where I am done with working physically demanding jobs for 10 times less anually
        than someone who works from home over seeing projects and in charge of multiple teams of fellow coders.
        Not to say that he has not put in the work, he deserves it from all the years he put in.
        I have always been interested in the tech industry, as it will never stop advancing.
